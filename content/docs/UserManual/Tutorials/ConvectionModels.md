A tutorial original developed for the CIDER 2016 summer programme at the Kavli Institute for
Theoretical Physics at UC Santa Barbara. This tutorial is meant to be tackled sequentially, starting from notebook zero (Overview). Maintainer: Louis Moresi.

You can run these notebooks live on [http://www.mybinder.org]( {{    nb_mybinder_location("notebooks/tutorials/ConvectionTutorial/000-Overview.ipynb") }} ) but be aware that
your work will not be saved unless you download it. You may also run out of time to complete the
exercises as the mybinder site is a public, shared resource.
